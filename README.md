Fig. 1 above shows the mask generation quality of MHParsNet. From Fig. 1, MHParsNet correctly detects and segments all human instances from the sample RGB image. Additionally, MHParsNet correctly detects and segments all but one body part. MHParsNet misses the ```Sunglasses``` object associated with the male subject, which reflects in the human and part instance mask prediction. However, this does not suggest that MHParsNet can not detect small objects; the abnormality is simply due to a false negative prediction. This assertion is validated by the fact that MHParsNet detects the relatively smaller ```Watch``` object on the wrist of the female subject. More test samples can be generated by executing ```test.py```.
