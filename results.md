## Multi-human parsing (segmentation) results
![Figure 2. Application algorithm](segmentation_result.png)
Fig. 1. Segmentation result of MHParsNet on the validation set of the MHPV2 dataset. In the body part semantic mask
generation, MHParsNet misses the sunglasses object, which is reflected in the instance segmentation mask. It was however able
to detect the smaller wristwatch object.
